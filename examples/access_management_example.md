# Access Management Example Usage

This guide demonstrates how to use the `AccessManagement` class from the `pysisense` package. Each example below includes a description and a code snippet for easy reference and copying.

---

## Prerequisites

- Ensure `config.yaml` is in the same folder as your script.
- Import required modules and initialize the API client and `AccessManagement` class.

```python
import os
import csv
import json
from pysisense import AccessManagement, SisenseClient

# Set the path to your config file
config_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "config.yaml")

# Initialize the API client
api_client = SisenseClient(config_file=config_path, debug=True)

# Initialize the AccessManagement class
access_mgmt = AccessManagement(api_client=api_client)
```

---

## Example 1: Get User Information by Email

Retrieve information for a specific user by their email.

```python
user_email = 'john.doe@example.com'
response = access_mgmt.get_user(user_email)
print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))

# Optional: Convert the response to a DataFrame and print
df = api_client.to_dataframe(response)
print(df)

# Optional: Export the response to a CSV file
api_client.export_to_csv(response, file_name="user_info.csv")
```

---

## Example 2: Get All Users

Fetch all users in the system.

```python
response = access_mgmt.get_users_all()
df = api_client.to_dataframe(response)
print(df)
api_client.export_to_csv(response, file_name="all_users.csv")
```

---

## Example 3: Create a New User (using role and group name)

Create a user by specifying their details, including role and groups.

```python
user_data = {
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",                    # Required: User's email address
    "firstName": "John",                                # Optional: User's first name
    "lastName": "Doe",                                  # Optional: User's last name
    "role": "dataDesigner",                             # Optional: Remove this field if not needed; if omitted, the user will be assigned the default role of 'viewer'. Cannot be an empty string.
    "groups": ["mig_test", "mig_test_2"],               # Optional: List of group names, can be an empty list if the user is not part of any group
    "password": "Sisense141!@",                         # Optional: Provide a password if needed; if omitted, the user will receive an email to set their password. Cannot be an empty string so remove this field if not needed.
    "preferences": {                                    # Optional: User preferences, such as language settings, can be an empty dict if not needed
        "language": "en-US"
    }
}
response = access_mgmt.create_user(user_data)
print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))
```

---

## Example 3b: Create Multiple Users from a CSV File

Bulk create users using a CSV file.

**Expected CSV format:**

```
email,firstName,lastName,role,groups,password,language
john.doe@example.com,John,Doe,dataDesigner,"groupa,groupb","Password123!","en-US"
jane.smith@example.com,Jane,Smith,viewer,"groupa","Password456!","fr-FR"
mike.jones@example.com,Mike,Jones,Designer,"","Password789!","es-ES"
```

**Code:**

```python
csv_file_path = 'new_user.csv'

with open(csv_file_path, mode="r", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    for row_num, row in enumerate(reader, start=1):
        if not row.get("email") or not row.get("password"):
            print(f"Skipping row {row_num}: missing email or password")
            continue

        user_data = {
            "email": row["email"],
            "firstName": row.get("firstName", ""),
            "lastName": row.get("lastName", ""),
            "role": row.get("role", "viewer"),
            "groups": [g.strip() for g in row.get("groups", "").split(",") if g.strip()],
            "password": row["password"],
            "preferences": {
                "language": row.get("language", "en-US")
            }
        }

        try:
            response = access_mgmt.create_user(user_data)
            print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))
            if "error" not in response:
                print(f"User {user_data['email']} created successfully.")
            else:
                print(f"Failed to create user {user_data['email']}: {response['error']}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error creating user {user_data['email']}: {e}")
```

```python
user_name = "mike.jones@example.com"
user_data = {
    "firstName": "Mikey",                                 # Optional: Update user's first name
    "lastName": "Jonesss",                                # Optional: Update user's last name
    "role": "designer",                                   # Optional: Role name to update; will be mapped to corresponding roleId
    "groups": ["mig_test"],                               # Optional: List of group names to update; will be mapped to corresponding group IDs

## Example 12: Create a Schedule Build for a DataModel in UTC

Create cron-based and interval-based schedules for DataModel builds.

**Cron-Based Schedule (specific days and time in UTC):**

```python
days = ["MON", "TUE", "FRI", "SAT", "SUN"]                      # Days of the week
hour = 21                                                       # 9 PM UTC
minute = 0                                                      # At the start of the hour
datamodel_name = 'pysense_databricks_ec'                        # Name of the DataModel

response = access_mgmt.create_schedule_build(
    days=days,
    hour=hour,
    minute=minute,
    datamodel_name=datamodel_name
)
if "error" not in response:
    print("Cron-based schedule created successfully:", response)
else:
    print("Failed to create schedule:", response["error"])
```

**Cron-Based Schedule for All Days:**

```python
days = ["*"]
hour = 2                                                        # 2 AM UTC
minute = 30
datamodel_name = 'pysense_databricks_ec'

response = access_mgmt.create_schedule_build(
    days=days,
    hour=hour,
    minute=minute,
    datamodel_name=datamodel_name,
    build_type="FULL"
)
if "error" not in response:
    print("Cron-based schedule created successfully:", response)
else:
    print("Failed to create schedule:", response["error"])
```

**Interval-Based Schedule (1 Hour):**

```python
datamodel_name = 'pysense_databricks_ec'

response = access_mgmt.create_schedule_build(
    datamodel_name=datamodel_name,
    interval_hours=1
)
if "error" not in response:
    print("Interval-based schedule created successfully:", response)
else:
    print("Failed to create schedule:", response["error"])
```

**Interval-Based Schedule (2 Days, 1 Hour, 4 Minutes):**

```python
datamodel_name = 'pysense_databricks_ec'

response = access_mgmt.create_schedule_build(
    datamodel_name=datamodel_name,
    interval_days=2,
    interval_hours=1,
    interval_minutes=4
)
if "error" not in response:
    print("Interval-based schedule created successfully:", response)
else:
    print("Failed to create schedule:", response["error"])
```
